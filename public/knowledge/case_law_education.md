# Case Law Education
Courts use prior decisions (case law) to interpret statutes. When reading a case:
- Identify the facts, the legal question, the rule, and the court's reasoning.
- Check jurisdiction (does it bind your court?) and date (is it still good law?).
- Use official court or state sites when possible; avoid blogs as primary sources.

We provide general pointers to public case repositories; we do **not** select or recommend specific cases for your facts.
